# Traffic Sign Classification

This project aims to classify traffic signs using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing images of various traffic signs along with their corresponding labels. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the type of traffic sign depicted in a given image.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of traffic signs collected from various sources. Each image is labeled with the corresponding traffic sign class. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to train, tune, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Model

The model architecture chosen for this task is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which has been proven effective in image classification tasks. The model is trained using the training set and validated using the validation set to ensure optimal performance.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using the test set, which contains unseen data. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying traffic signs.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Train the model using the provided scripts or notebooks.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using the test set.
5. Make predictions on new traffic sign images using the trained model.

## Results

## Future Improvements

Possible future improvements to enhance the performance of the model include:

- Data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training set.
- Fine-tuning the model architecture to better suit the characteristics of traffic sign images.
- Experimenting with different optimization algorithms and learning rates.
- Incorporating ensemble learning methods to combine the predictions of multiple models.
